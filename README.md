## Bitcoinâ€™s historical prices data in xlsx format:
<p align="left"> For this part of the task, I found a third-party library named python-binance. The way this library work needed Binance API to connect to the Binance servers via Python or several other programming languages. due to that, the first step is to create an account with Binance. An API key should be created after it. </p>

**Installing library:**

```
pip install python-binance
```
